If the hostile power fails to affect the target due to this penalty, it still activates and consumes Power Points (and may still affect other targets). If the power causes harm, damage is also reduced a like amount for the protected target.

INSERT INTO powers VALUES(4,'Burst',2,'Cone Template','Instant','core','Burst produces a large fan of energy that bathes its targets in red-hot fire, a cone of cold, or other damaging matter or energy.

INSERT INTO powers VALUES(6,'Deflection',2,'Smarts','5','core','Deflection powers work in a variety of ways. Some actually deflect incoming attacks, others blur the target''s form or produce illusionary effects. The end result is the same, however—to misdirect incoming attacks. With success, foes must subtract 2 from either melee or ranged attacks (caster''s choice). With a raise, the penalty applies to both. An attacker using a ranged weapon in melee against the recipient suffers the penalty either way.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(7,'Protection',1,'Smarts','5','core','Protection creates a field of energy or armor around a character, giving him 2 points of Armor. With a raise, the bonus is applied to Toughness instead. Whether the protection is visible or not depends on the Trapping. Protection stacks with all other armor, natural or worn, and is negated by AP as usual.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(8,'Smite',2,'Smarts','5','core','This power is cast on a weapon of some sort. If it''s a ranged weapon, it affects one entire magazine, 20 bolts, shells, or arrows, or one full "load" of ammunition (the GM determines the exact quantity for unusual weapons). While the power is in effect, the weapon''s damage is increased by +2, or +4 with a raise.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(9,'Stun',2,'Smarts','Instant','core','Stun shocks a target with concussive force, sound, light, magical energy, or the like.

INSERT INTO powers VALUES(10,'Banish',3,'Smarts','Instant','core','Banish sends entities from immaterial planes back to their native dimensions. This includes ghosts, demons, elementals, and similar beings (at the GM''s discretion). Banishing a being is an opposed roll of the caster''s arcane skill versus the target''s Spirit. Success means the target is Shaken, and each raise causes a Wound. If this Incapacitates the target it returns to its native plane of existence. Banished entities may return when the Game Master feels it''s appropriate, such as the next full moon, when summoned again, or even a few rounds later if it''s a particularly powerful creature under the right conditions or in a location of power.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(11,'Barrier',2,'Smarts','5','core','Barrier creates a straight wall 5″ (10 yards) long and 1″ (two yards) tall, of immobile material that conforms to the surface it''s cast upon. Thickness varies depending on what the wall is made of, but is usually a few inches. The wall has a Hardness of 10, and may be destroyed as any other object. When the spell expires or the wall is broken it crumbles to dust or dissipates. Trappings are never left behind.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(12,'Blind',2,'Smarts','Instant','core','Those affected by this malicious power suffer blurred vision or near-complete blindness with a raise. Success means the victim suffers a −2 penalty to all actions requiring sight, or −4 with a raise. The victim automatically tries to shake off the effect with a Vigor roll as a free action at the end of his following turns. Success removes 2 points of penalties, and a raise removes the effect entirely.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(13,'Confusion',1,'Smarts','Until the end of the victim''s next turn','core','Confusion confounds all targets in a Medium Blast Template, making them either Distracted or Vulnerable, or both with a raise. The same effect applies to all those affected. These states are removed at the end of the victim''s next turn as usual.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(14,'Entangle',2,'Smarts','Instant','core','Entangle allows the caster to restrain a target with ice, bands of energy, or other vine-like Trappings (Hardness 8). If successful, the target is Entangled. With a raise, he''s Bound. Victims may break free on their turn as detailed under Bound & Entangled on page 92.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(15,'Fear',2,'Smarts','Instant','core','This power causes overwhelming dread and horror. The affected make a Fear roll. Extras who fail are Panicked and Wild Cards roll on the Fear Table.

INSERT INTO powers VALUES(16,'Havoc',2,'Smarts','Instant','core','This ability creates chaos and mischief for all those within its area of effect, hurling debris and rivals in all directions. With success, the caster places a Medium Blast Template anywhere within Range, or a Cone Template emanating from the caster. Anyone touched by the template is Distracted and must then make a Strength roll (at −2 if the caster got a raise). Those who fail are hurled 2d6″—directly away from the caster if using the Cone Template or directly away from the center if using a Blast Template. Victims who strike a hard object take 2d4 damage (nonlethal unless it''s a spiked wall or other more dangerous hazard). Airborne targets suffer an additional −2 to their Strength rolls.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(17,'Puppet',3,'Smarts','5','core','Puppet is an opposed roll of the character''s arcane skill versus the target''s Spirit. With success, the victim obeys commands that don''t directly harm himself or those he cares about. With a raise, the target will harm himself or others (including by inaction). In either event, any time he''s ordered to harm himself or those he cares about, including by inaction, he gets a Spirit roll as a free action. If successful, he doesn''t carry out that particular command but remains a puppet. With a raise, he breaks the controller''s hold and the power ends. Commands are general, such as "attack that person" or "open that door."','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(18,'Sloth/Speed',2,'Smarts','Instant (sloth); 5 (speed)','core','Sloth lessens celerity and coordination while speed increases it. Sloth halves the target''s total movement each round (round up). With a raise, movement is also an action. The target automatically attempts to shake off the effects of sloth at the end of each of his next turns by making a Spirit roll. Success with speed doubles the target''s movement (basic Pace and running). With a raise the character also ignores the −2 running penalty.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(19,'Slumber',2,'Smarts','One hour','core','Those who favor stealth or want to avoid harming their foes are drawn to this spell, which puts its victims into a deep and restful sleep. Anyone affected by slumber must make a Spirit roll (at −2 if the caster got a raise on her arcane skill roll). Those who fail fall asleep for the Duration of the spell. Very loud noises or attempts to physically wake a sleeper (by shaking him, for example), grant another Spirit roll.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(20,'Boost/Lower Trait',3,'Smarts','5 (boost); Instant (lower)','core','This power allows a character to increase or decrease a target''s Trait (attribute or skill). Boosting an ally''s Trait increases the selected Trait one die type, or two with a raise, for five rounds. Lowering an enemy''s Trait has a Duration of Instant and lowers the selected attribute or skill a die type with success, or two with a raise (to a minimum of d4). A victim automatically tries to shake off the effect with a Spirit roll as a free action at the end of his following turns. Success improves the effect one die type, and a raise removes the effect entirely. Additional castings don''t stack on a single Trait (take the highest), but may affect different Traits.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(21,'Darksight',1,'Smarts','One hour','core','Darksight allows a hero to see in the dark. With success, he ignores up to 4 points of illumination penalties. With a raise, he ignores up to six points and can see in pitch darkness.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(22,'Farsight',2,'Smarts','5','core','Farsight allows the recipient to see in detail over great distances. She can read lips or read fine print up to a mile distant. With a raise, she also halves Range penalties for Shooting, Athletics (throwing), or other abilities affected by Range.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(23,'Fly',3,'Smarts','5','core','Fly allows a character to soar at Pace 12″, or twice that with a raise (he may not Run).','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(24,'Growth/Shrink',2,'Smarts','5','core','Growth increases the recipient''s Size by 1 for every 2 Power Points spent. Each increase in Size grants the target a one-step increase to Strength and 1 point of Toughness. Shrink reduces the Size of the subject one step for every 2 Power Points spent to a maximum of Size −2 (approximately the size of a cat). Each step reduced decreases Strength one die type (minimum of d4) and Toughness by 1 (minimum of 2). For unwilling targets, the caster''s arcane skill roll is opposed by Spirit.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(25,'Relief',1,'Smarts','Instant','core','Relief allows the caster to recover from a negative condition or the effects of Fatigue. Recover: The caster removes one of the following conditions: Shaken, Distracted, or Vulnerable. A raise on the arcane skill roll removes two conditions. Relief can''t remove conditions caused by ongoing effects (Bound or Entangled, Stunned, etc.) unless the source of the effect is removed. Numb: Reduces the recipient''s total penalties from Wounds and Fatigue by one with success, or two with a raise. This effect lasts one hour. It doesn''t actually remove the Wounds or the Fatigue, it just allows the recipient to ignore the penalties.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(26,'Sound/Silence',1,'Smarts ×5 (sound); Smarts (silence)','Instant (sound); 5 (silence)','core','Sound mimics any known sound or voice, emanating from a point of origin within Range at a volume up to the sound of a loud shout. If used as a Test, the defender opposes the casting roll with Smarts. Silence does the opposite, muting all sound up to a loud shout within a Large Blast Template. This subtracts 4 from Notice rolls made by those inside the area of effect, as well as anyone trying to hear sounds made from within. A raise completely mutes all sound inside the template—such Notice rolls automatically fail.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(27,'Wall Walker',2,'Smarts','5','core','Wall walker allows the recipient to walk on vertical or horizontal surfaces. With success, she moves at half her normal Pace. With a raise, she may move at full Pace and even run. If forced to make an Athletics roll to climb or hang on to a surface, she adds +4 to the total.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(28,'Warrior''s Gift',4,'Smarts','5','core','With a successful arcane skill roll, the recipient gains the benefits of a single Combat Edge chosen by the caster. The caster (not the recipient) must have the same Rank or higher as the Edge''s Requirements. With a raise, the recipient gains the Improved version of the Edge (if there is one, and even if he doesn''t meet the Rank Requirement).','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(29,'Healing',3,'Touch','Instant','core','Healing removes Wounds less than an hour old. A success removes one Wound, and a raise removes two. The power may be cast additional times to remove additional Wounds within that hour and as long as the healer has enough Power Points. For Extras, the GM must first determine if the ally is still alive. If so, a successful arcane skill roll returns the ally to action (Shaken if it matters.)','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(30,'resurrection',30,'Touch','Instant','core','Perhaps the greatest power of all is the ability to bring someone back from the dead. It can restore lost loves, bring solace to the grieving, and topple kingdoms. Returning the dead to life requires a reasonably complete corpse no more than a year old. The caster then prays, meditates, chants, or otherwise concentrates on mending the body and pulling the spirit back to it for four hours. Once done, the healer makes a casting roll at −8. If successful, the victim returns to life with three Wounds and is Exhausted. With a raise, she returns merely Exhausted.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(31,'speak_language',1,'Smarts','10 minutes','core','This power allows a character to speak, read, and write a sapient language other than his own. A raise on the arcane skill roll allows the user to appropriately use and understand slang and dialect as well.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(32,'Detect/Conceal Arcana',2,'Smarts','5 rounds (detect); 1 hour (conceal)','core','Detect arcana allows the recipient to see and detect all supernatural persons, objects, or effects in sight for five rounds. This includes invisible foes, enchantments on people or items, weird science devices, and so on. With a raise, the caster knows the general type of enchantment. When used on a supernatural creature, the caster learns its active powers and arcane abilities. With a raise, he knows Weaknesses common to that creature type. Detect arcana also allows a character to ignore up to 4 points of penalties when attacking foes hidden by magical darkness, invisibility, or similar abilities (or all penalties with a raise). Conceal arcana prevents detection of arcane energies on one being or item of Normal Scale for one hour. With success, attempts to detect arcana on the being or item suffer a −2 penalty or −4 with a raise.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(33,'Dispel',1,'Smarts','Instant','core','Dispel allows a hero to negate enemy powers. It has no effect on permanent enchantments or innate abilities such as a dragon''s breath or a banshee''s scream. Dispel affects arcane devices normally. Dispel can target a character with a power already in effect or a caster activating a power. The latter counters the power but requires the countering mage to be on Hold and interrupt his foe''s action. In either case, dispelling an opponent''s power is an opposed roll of arcane skills (with a −2 modifier if the rival''s power is of another type such as magic vs. miracles, psionics vs. weird science, etc.). If the dispelling character wins, the targeted power ends immediately (or fails if it was countered with the usual results of failure). With a raise, the recipient of the dispelled power is also Distracted.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(34,'Divination',5,'Self','5 minutes','core','Divination allows the caster to contact otherworldly beings or forces to gain information. Preparing the spell takes one uninterrupted minute, and must be done at a site relevant to the spirit being contacted. If speaking with a ghost, for example, the conversation should occur at its grave, where it was killed, or with a personal object in hand. After the preparation time is complete, the caster makes her arcane skill roll. Success allows her to engage with the spirit and ask it any questions she might have. The entity must answer to the best of its ability, as directly or ambiguously as the Game Master feels fits the spirit''s personality and the feel of her campaign. A raise means the spirit is more helpful, knowledgeable, or direct than usual. The type of entity contacted determines how it communicates. Once a spirit has been conversed with it may not be contacted again for 24 hours.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(35,'Empathy',1,'Smarts','5 rounds','core','A successful arcane skill vs Spirit roll gives the caster insight into a target''s basic emotions. This grants him a +1 bonus (+2 with a raise) to all Intimidation, Persuasion, Performance, or Taunt rolls against the target for the Duration of the power. The bonus does not apply to skill rolls made to activate powers. Empathy works on animals, adding +1 (+2 with a raise) to Riding or other rolls to interact with the creature.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(36,'Illusion',3,'Smarts','5 rounds','core','Illusion can be used to create a visual scene or replica of most anything the caster can imagine, but it is silent, intangible, and incapable of affecting the real world. For example, illusionary weapons pass through foes, one cannot sit in an illusionary chair, and an illusionary dog has no audible bark. Those who contact an illusion or doubt it''s real make a Smarts roll as a free action (at −2 if the power was activated with a raise). If successful, that individual is no longer subject to this casting. The GM should make group rolls for Extras as they point out the illusion''s inconsistencies to each other. The volume of the illusion must fit within a sphere the size of a Medium Blast Template (4″ or eight yards in diameter).','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(37,'Mind Link',1,'Smarts','30 minutes','core','Mind link creates a telepathic connection between two individuals (which does not necessarily have to include the caster). The link accommodates only willing subjects and communication—thoughts that aren''t consciously transmitted aren''t relayed. Once activated, the Range between all linked minds is one mile, or five with a raise. If any of the linked characters suffers a Wound, all others must make a Smarts roll or be Shaken (this cannot cause a Wound). The speed of communication is that of normal speech, but with a raise members may communicate up to 30 seconds or so of speech on a single combat turn.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(38,'Mind Reading',2,'Smarts','Instant','core','Mind reading is an opposed roll versus the target''s Smarts. Success allows the character to gain one truthful answer from the subject. The target is aware of the mental intrusion unless the mind reader gets a raise. The GM may apply modifiers based on the subject''s mental Hindrances or current state of mind.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(39,'Mind Wipe',3,'Smarts','Instant','core','Mind wipe removes a target''s memories, a terrible violation in most civilized societies. The power is opposed by a victim''s Smarts and requires a full minute of mental struggle. The victim must be conscious during this time, so if not restrained he can simply move out of Range. If successful, the victim forgets a single event (up to about 30 minutes of time). A raise removes a complex memory of several hours. If the defender wins, the caster cannot affect him with mind wipe for 24 hours. (Others may reattempt the power, however.) The memory remains missing but strong evidence that challenges its "logic" allows a Smarts roll at −2 to remember fragments determined by the GM.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(40,'Object Reading',2,'Touch','Special','core','Object reading is the ability to get visions of the past from an object. With a successful casting, the reader gains a vague impression of whatever information she''s looking for, from the object''s creation forward. A raise grants her more specific information. If the caster uses object reading on a bloody knife to investigate a murder, for example, success might tell her the wielder was a human and that the attack happened at night. With a raise, she might get a glimpse of the killer''s face or some other clue that reveals his identity.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(41,'Beast Friend',0,'Smarts','10 minutes','core','This spell allows an individual to speak with and guide the actions of nature''s beasts. The cost to cast is equal to the sum of their Size (minimum 1 per creature). Success means the creatures obey simple commands, like a well-trained dog. They attack foes and endanger their lives for their master. A raise on the arcane skill roll means the beasts are more obedient. They won''t kill themselves but overcome their natural fears to follow their orders. Swarms can also be controlled. Small Swarms cost 1 point, Medium Swarms cost 2, and Large Swarms cost 3. Beast friend works only on natural creatures with animal intelligence, not humanoids, and has no effect on conjured, magical, or otherwise "unnatural" animals.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(42,'Elemental Manipulation',1,'Smarts','5','core','This power grants basic control over the four traditional elements: air, earth, fire, and water. The power acts as if it has a d6 Strength, or d8 with a raise. Upon activation, the caster may choose one of the following effects: ATTACK (2d4 damage, 3d4 with raise), MOVE (move a cubic foot of element up to Smarts), PUSH (use activation roll in place of Strength for Push), or SPECIAL EFFECTS (create additional effects with GM approval). After activation, each additional use of the effects above is an action.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(43,'Drain Power Points',2,'Smarts','Instant','core','Powerful mages, priests, psykers, and the like can use this ability to drain arcane energy from their foes. They can sometimes even leech the stolen energy for themselves. The power is opposed by the target''s Spirit, and the caster suffers a −2 penalty to her roll if the target has a different Arcane Background than her own. Success drains 1d6 of the rival''s Power Points (if any, and the die doesn''t Ace). With a raise, the caster adds the points to her own. This may take her above her usual maximum! They last until used, and must be the first spent when casting. Drain Power Points can also be used on an arcane device (the creator still resists with her arcane skill whether she wields it or not).','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(44,'Summon Ally',2,'Smarts','5','core','This power allows the character to summon a magical servant from nothing. The ally typically takes the form of a basic humanoid of the appropriate Size but can appear differently based on the caster''s trappings. It materializes anywhere in Range, and with a raise on the arcane skill roll, it''s Resilient as well. The ally acts on its creator''s Action Card and follows her commands to the best of its ability. It has no personality, creativity, or emotions. When the power ends or the ally is Incapacitated, it fades into nothingness, leaving no trace behind. Cost varies: Attendant (1), Bodyguard (3), Sentinel (5), Mirror Self (7).','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(45,'Telekinesis',5,'Smarts ×2','5','core','Telekinesis is the ability to move objects or creatures (including oneself) with arcane will. It has a Strength of d10, or d12 with a raise. On activation, the caster may immediately perform one of the uses below. Subsequent uses are actions and use the arcane skill (but are not activation rolls and therefore not subject to Backlash from Critical Failures). Unwilling beings targeted by telekinesis resist the caster''s arcane skill with an opposed Spirit roll when first targeted, and at the start of each of their turns thereafter until they''re released. USES: BASH (Str+d6 damage), CHANGE TARGETS (release/pick up as free action, new unwilling target is action), MANIPULATE (use tools or wield weapon with arcane skill), MOVE (move target up to Smarts as limited free action).','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');
INSERT INTO powers VALUES(46,'Zombie',3,'Smarts','One hour','core','Zombie grants animation and basic intelligence to the remains of a once-living being. The summoned horror is obedient but literal-minded in its duties. It isn''t telepathic, and must be controlled by voice. The being has the physical skills it had in life, but its Smarts, Spirit, and related skills are reset to d4. A raise on the casting roll increases any one of their Traits by one die type (caster''s choice). Corpses aren''t summoned by this ability, so there must actually be a supply of bodies in Range. An undead Incapacitated by damage can''t be raised with this power again. Animals and other creatures can also be raised: 2 PP for Size -1/-2, 3 PP for Size 0, 1/2/3 PP for Small/Medium/Large Swarms. Larger creatures cost 3 + Size in Power Points.','2025-10-08 06:13:12','2025-10-08 06:13:12');

The link accommodates only willing subjects and communication-thoughts that aren''t consciously transmitted aren''t relayed. Once activated, the Range between linked minds is one mile, or five with a raise. If any of the linked characters suffers a Wound, all others must make a Smarts roll or be Shaken (this cannot cause a Wound). The speed of communication is that of normal speech, but with a raise members may communicate up to 30 seconds or so of speech on a single combat turn.','2026-01-04 19:30:55','2026-01-04 19:30:55');

INSERT INTO powers VALUES(95,'Mind Wipe',3,'Smarts','Instant','fantasy_companion','Mind wipe removes a target''s memories, a terrible violation in most civilized societies. The power is opposed by a victim''s Smarts and requires a full minute of mental struggle. The victim must be conscious during this time, so if not restrained he can simply move out of Range. If successful, the victim forgets a single event (up to about 30 minutes of time). A raise removes a complex memory of several hours. If the defender wins, the caster cannot affect him with mind wipe for 24 hours. (Others may reattempt the power, however.) The memory remains missing, but strong evidence that challenges its "logic" allows a Smarts roll at -2 to remember fragments determined by the GM.','2026-01-04 19:30:55','2026-01-04 19:30:55');

With a successful casting, she gains a vague impression of whatever information she''s looking for, from the object''s creation forward. A raise grants her more specific information. If the caster uses object reading on a bloody knife to investigate a murder, for example, success might tell her the wielder was a human and that the attack happened at night. With a raise, she might get a glimpse of the killer''s face or some other clue that reveals his identity.','2026-01-04 19:31:18','2026-01-04 19:31:18');

If she''s Shaken or Stunned during this time, the spell fails. If the caster has never seen the target herself, she makes her arcane skill roll at -2. Scrying on a target in a different plane of existence also imposes a -2 penalty. Scrying is opposed by the subject''s Spirit. If the target wins, he knows he''s being spied on. If the caster wins, he can see and hear the target and the area around it but cannot move his perspective. With a raise, he can shift perspective and follow the target at a Pace 24.

The trap is created with chalk, salt, glyphs and wards, or other materials prior to the power''s activation, and takes ten minutes to prepare. Once the trap is prepared, the caster selects an extra-planar entity to summon. She must know about the creature somehow, perhaps by previous encounter, access to books and scrolls, or an Occult roll with a modifier set by the Game Master. The caster can summon a specific entity if she knows its proper name. Casting is an opposed roll between the caster''s arcane skill and the entity''s Spirit. If the spell fails the entity knows who attempted to bind it. If the caster rolls a Critical Failure, the creature may appear if it chooses to and is unbound-it may do as it wishes and its abilities allow. If the caster wins, the creature is summoned into the trap and magically bound there until it agrees to perform a service for the caster or breaks free. The Power Points used to bind the target are invested and unavailable until the creature breaks free or completes its task.

It has no personality, creativity, or emotions. When the power ends or the ally is Incapacitated, it fades into nothingness, leaving no trace behind. The type of servant that can be summoned depends on the caster''s Rank. Attendant (Novice, 1 PP), Bodyguard (Seasoned, 3 PP), Sentinel (Veteran, 5 PP), Mirror Self (Heroic, 7 PP).

They understand simple commands such as attack a particular target, push that rock, and so on, but are animals and act as such. Summoned animals act on the caster''s Action Card.

Summon undead doesn''t require existing corpses but brings them from wherever they currently haunt to the necromancer''s current location. They serve for a limited time, but are much more powerful than those typically summoned in groaning hordes of walking dead or clinking mobs of chattering skeletons. Summoned undead appear as listed in the Bestiary, including any equipment in their profile. When the power expires, the loathsome dead fade back through shadow to their original location.

The being has the physical skills it had in life, but its Smarts, Spirit, and related skills are reset to d4. A raise on the casting roll increases any one of their Traits one die type (caster''s choice). See Savage Worlds for the standard profile of a human zombie. Corpses aren''t summoned by this ability, so there must actually be a supply of bodies in Range (GM''s call).

A burrowing character may attempt to surprise a foe by making an opposed Stealth versus Notice roll. If the burrower wins, the target is Vulnerable to him only. With a raise, the burrower gets the Drop. Targets on Hold may attempt to interrupt the attack before it occurs.

Conjured items appear in the hands of the caster or on the ground nearby. Once the Duration expires, the item fades from reality.

Invisible Creatures: Detect arcana also allows a character to ignore up to 4 points of penalties when attacking foes hidden by magical darkness, invisibility, or similar abilities (or all penalties with a raise).

Preparing the spell takes one uninterrupted minute of prayer, coaxing or otherwise communing with a spirit or deity. Once that''s done, the caster makes her arcane skill roll. Success means the entity answers the character''s questions to the best of its ability. A raise means the spirit is more helpful, knowledgeable, or direct than usual (whether it wants to be or not). Answers are typically vague or symbolic rather than direct-they provide clues and guidance rather than spoilers that ruin a mystery or adventure.
